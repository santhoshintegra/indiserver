#Short description of the PL2303 driver

== What's supported ==

# PL2303 and newer PL2303HX-types (both tested) with ProductID 0x2303 and VendorID 0x067b
# You can select one PL2303 out of multiple connected to your device
# Serial parameters: Baudrate, Databits, Stopbits, Parity and something like basic RTS/CTS Flow-Control
# Monitoring of Status-Lines DCD, DSR, RI and CTS

== What's NOT supported (at least at the moment)==

# 3rd party PL2303 with different ProductID/VendorID
# Selecting one specific PL2303 out of multiple connected ones, because most of them don't have a S/N and thus can't be uniquely identified. The Android USB-Host-API just numbers them in the order they were connected.
# RFR/CTS, DTR/DSR and XON/XOFF Flow-Control
