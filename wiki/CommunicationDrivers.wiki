Communication drivers are used to physicaly connect to the hardware


= Details =

Communication drivers act as a transport layer. They connect over a medium like bluetooth, usb, serial or network to the devices and present a standardized interface to the actual device drivers.

The following drivers should be available:

*serial* for direct communication via /dev/ttyS or /dev/ttyUSB

*bluetooth_serial* for communication via Bluetooth-SPP

*usbhost_serial_pl2303* for USB-to-serial adapters with pl2303 chipset using the usbhost feature of Android 3.2 and higher.

In the far future there can also be

*usbhost_lpi* for Meade LunarPlanetaryImager

*usbhost_dsi* for Meade DeepSkyImager

*usbhost_canon_dslr* for Canon DSLRs 

... and much more!
