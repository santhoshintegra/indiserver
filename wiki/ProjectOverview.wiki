This project aims to implement an INDI server on Android.

= Details =

I'd like to control my telescope with my Android-devices, specifically with SkyMap. INDI is an open-source hardware-independent control protocol for astronomical hardware. To implement a server it first requires development of telescope-drivers, as well as communication-drivers.

The telescope-driver interfaces to the telescope itself via the com-driver.
The INDI-Server then interfaces with the telescope-driver and listens on a network-port for clients to connect. 

The clients (such as SkyMap or SkEye) then send INDI-commands to the server and the server sends them via the drivers to the telescope.

INDI-messages are xml-messages, the server only relays them to the drivers.
Xml-parsing itself must be done by the drivers.

It is also possible to send INDI-messages from apps directly to the drivers, but this way it isn't possible that more than one app/client at the same time can use the driver. Also it then isn't possible to remote control a telescope connected to an android-device via network.

There are some well-known clients already using INDI:
