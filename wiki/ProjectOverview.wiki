This project aims to implement an INDI server on Android.

I'd like to control my telescope with my Android-devices, specifically with SkyMap. INDI is an open-source hardware-independent control protocol for astronomical hardware. To implement a server it first requires development of telescope-drivers, as well as communication-drivers.

The telescope-driver interfaces to the telescope itself via the com-driver.
The INDI-Server then interfaces with the telescope-driver and listens on a network-port for clients to connect. 

The clients (such as SkyMap or SkEye) then send INDI-commands to the server and the server sends them via the drivers to the telescope.

INDI-messages are xml-messages, the server only relays them to the drivers.
Xml-parsing itself must be done by the drivers.

It is also possible to send INDI-messages from apps directly to the drivers, but this way it isn't possible that more than one app at the same time can use the driver. Also it then isn't possible to remote control a telescope connected to an android-device via network.
