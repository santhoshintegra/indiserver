= Introduction =

I'm 36 years and from Germany. I began coding mid of the 80s with Locomotive Basic on an Amstrad CPC464. After that I got my first x86 PC and began coding with Turbo Pascal (I had a hard time understanding OOP in TP6.0). This went on until Borland Delphi 7 with which I've done some job-related projects.
I'm also able to read and understand most C/C++ code, but I don't like it very much because it seems somewhat cryptic to me compared to pascal.
Around 2004 my employer went bankrupt and in my new job coding was not needed anymore. 2012 I jumped into Android and Java, so my coding skills are a little bit rusty :) 

This is my first own open-source project, but as Linux user since 1998 I'm very familiar with open-source in general. 

I'd appreciate every comment, criticism or help.
