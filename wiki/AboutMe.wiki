= Introduction =

I'm 37 years and from Germany. I began coding mid of the 80s with Locomotive Basic on an Amstrad CPC464. After that I got my first x86 PC and began coding with Turbo Pascal (I had a hard time understanding OOP in TP6.0). This went on until Borland Delphi 7 with which I've done some job-related projects. Later I used (and use today) FreePascal under Linux.

I'm also able to read and understand most C/C++ code, but I don't like it very much because it seems somewhat cryptic to me compared to pascal. 

I've also done some assembly coding on Z80, early x86 (8088/80286), a Motorola 6502 based  development board named "C-Control" and the Atmega-based "AVR-NET-IO" development board. 

Around 2004 my employer went bankrupt and in my new job coding was not needed anymore and I lost my interest almost completely. 

2012 I jumped into Android and Java and for now I'm very happy with it, but my coding skills are a little bit rusty :) 

This is my first own open-source project, but as Linux user since 1998 I'm very familiar with open-source in general. 

I'd appreciate every comment, criticism or help.
