=My testing equipment=

==Hardware==

*Android devices*

 * Vodafone 845 (Huawei 8120), Android 2.1, rooted with custom ROM
 * LG P350 OptimusMe, Android 2.2, rooted standard ROM
 * Archos 70H, Android 2.2, unrooted
 * Archos 101G9, Android 4.0.3, unrooted

*Telescope*

 * Meade LXD-75 mount with Autostar-Handbox, 6" 150mm/1200mm Newton

*Bluetooth-Adaptor*

 * Sphinx Elektronik PicoPlug, Serial-Port-Profile

*Imager*

 * Meade LPI, CMOS 640x480px, up to 16s exposure time with original Windows-driver

*Camera*

 * Canon EOS350D, unmodified

For a complete remote controlable observatory there will be some secondary telescope for autoguiding with the LPI and some sort of electric focuser (self-built) later, but not yet. Also I plan to buy an 8" 200mm/1000mm OTA with a better crayford focuser (the actual one is very cheap, not to say crappy).

==Software==

Debian Sid, KDE 4.7, Android SDK, Eclipse IDE with Subversive PlugIn, KStars 2.0.0
