# My testing equipment #

## Hardware ##

**Android devices**

  * Vodafone 845 (Huawei 8120), Android 2.3.7 CM7.2, rooted with custom ROM
  * HTC One V, Android 4.1.2 CM 10, rooted with custom ROM
  * Archos 70H, Android 2.2, unrooted
  * Archos 101G9, Android 4.0.4, unrooted (main development device)

**Telescope**

  * Meade LXD-75 mount with Autostar #497 Handbox, 6" 150mm/1200mm Newton

**USB-Serial-Converter**

  * About 5-6 PL2303 Converters Standard and HX-Type

**Bluetooth-Adaptor**

  * Sphinx Elektronik PicoPlug, Serial-Port-Profile

**Imager**

  * Meade LPI, CMOS 640x480px, up to 16s exposure time with original Windows-driver

**Camera**

  * Canon EOS350D, unmodified

For a complete remote controlable observatory there will be some secondary telescope for autoguiding with the LPI and some sort of electric focuser (self-built) later, but not yet. Also I plan to buy an 8" 200mm/1000mm OTA with a better crayford focuser (the actual one is very cheap, not to say crappy).
