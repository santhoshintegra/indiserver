# Introduction #

This project aimed to implement an INDI server on Android and a free, open-source PL2303-Driver for Android (no root required).

For details about INDI click here: http://indilib.org/

This project is partially obsolete with the release of the INDIforJava Server.

Please look at https://sourceforge.net/projects/indiforjava/

Thanks go to Zerjillo, the developer of INDIforJava for his great work.

I'll concentrate now on the LX200-telescope driver.

The Telecope-Driver as well as a PL2303-Driver for direct serial communication via Android Host Mode are basically working. Please look under the "Source"-Section.

**Short description and How-To-Use of the PL2303driver:** http://code.google.com/p/indiserver/wiki/PL2303driver

For those who are interested, I've got a test-app for the PL2303-Driver.
It's a quick-and-dirty hack with almost no exception-handling and documentation, but works. The driver itself is well documented and tested:

After I broke the touch-digitizer of my Archos-Tablet, I haven't done any more development. As soon as I can afford the repair I'll be back with this project.
**Update:** The repair is not worth it (a new touch-panel costs about 80 EUR in ebay). I'm using a cheap bluetooth-mouse instead now and thinking about buying a Nexus 4 or Nexus 7.
